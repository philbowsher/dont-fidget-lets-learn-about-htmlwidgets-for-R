# Univarsal Data Visualization Shiny App Training Exercises

Welcome! Using this app, we will guide you through a series of exercises that will introduce:
- ggplot2
- R Markdown (RMD)
- RMD & Flexdashboards
- Shiny
- htmlwidgets & Plotly

Rule for an update/pull request is that it must be univarsal and not require unique changes per data/use-case.

This app will work on most reasonably sized datasets.
